# Homework Assignment 18

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PGE383-HPC/assignment18.svg?token=SnMGq692xXXqxzyE6QSj&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PGE383-HPC/assignment18)

This assignment is basically a repeat of [Homework Assignment 15](https://github.com/PGE383-HPC-Fall2018/assignment15) were we wrote a `ParallelToughness` class that computes a materials toughness given stress/strain data in file in parallel using `mpi4py`.  Except in this assignment, we will use Epetra data structures and import/export operations to manually load balance the data for the parallel computation.  You should complete the new `EpetraParallelToughness` class. 

I have included a solution to [Homework Assignment 8](https://github.com/PGE383-HPC-Spring2018/assignment8) which includes the class `StressStrainConverter` to read in the data file and create the class attributes `true_stress` and `true_strain`.  You should use `Epetra.Vector`s and create an `Epetra.Import` object to help distribute the data contained in these attributes as evenly as possibly over the `NumProc` of the parallel computation.  **Do not use Isorropia** as a load balancer, that will be the subject of the next assignment.  

Your code should be parallel consistent, i.e. it should produce the exact same answer independent of the number of processors you specify.

## Testing

If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, run the following commands at the Terminal command line:

```bash
mpiexec -np 2 python test.py
mpiexec -np 4 python test.py
```
